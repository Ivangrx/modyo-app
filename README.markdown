# Modyo OAuth API Ruby example

This little app demonstrates how to use Modyo OAuth API to authorize an application, fetch user info using that authorization and, if the user has granted permission, check in on behalf of that user.

## How to Get It Running

- `Install oauth gem 0.4.4`

Open file modyo.yml and change "key", "secret" and site "values" and run server.

Now open up `http://0.0.0.0:3000/` in your browser and everything should be ready to go!
